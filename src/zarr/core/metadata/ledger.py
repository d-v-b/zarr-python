"""The ledger of stored metadata that does not conform to the Zarr specifications.

Each entry is one kind of stored metadata that is not conformant (the specification
forbids it) or not registered (it uses a name the zarr-extensions registry does not
define), which zarr-python writes or reads. An entry records which software wrote it,
whether zarr still writes it, and how zarr reads it now. The Metadata compatibility page
of the documentation lists this ledger.

Every place in `src/zarr` that reads or writes such metadata carries a comment naming
its entry, `# NON-CONFORMANT: <key>` or `# UNREGISTERED: <key>`, so a reader of the code
finds the entry and the entry can be checked against the code: `tests/test_ledger.py`
fails if a marker names no entry, if an entry has no marker, or if a repair in
`zarr.core.metadata.repair.ARRAY_REPAIRS` is in no entry.

The ledger records zarr releases; the warnings zarr gives describe the metadata only.
